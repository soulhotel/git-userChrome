- This is pretty much first attempt at making a gui for anything & first attempt at using python. So we'll see how this goes..
- My approach is a bit on the easy side, 99% of the ui was made in qtdesigner, so I pretty much skipped the how-to create part & focus more on assigning functionality, eventually I'll need to revisit this and learn, because the overall sizing of elements in the scrollable widget need work
- Sidebar trigger needs better placement (preferably by having the tab index moved left. Im going to end up blowing up this entire layout just to accomplish that
- Dialog buttons need to be replaced in favor of toggle switches. There was a hacky approach that I thought of, using ui/button/toggle gifs and setting the gifs to a midway state on selection, then end/begin state on unselection. Harder then it seems. Might need a library instead
- Notification, button inputs need better visual acknowledgement
