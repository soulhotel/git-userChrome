# Git userChrome..

###### ...A tool to git userChrome Themes from anywhere.

</div>

## Overview:

A cross-platform gui for gituserChrome, python & QT. Goal is to create a lightweight frontend for everything userChrome. Browsing, managing, & installing userChrome themes onto any firefox profile, into any firefox install, all in maybe 1 to 3 clicks.

With PyQt6 | pyqt6-tools, this app can be run with `python main.py` for now.

- This is pretty much first attempt at making a gui for anything & first attempt at using python. So we'll see how this goes..
- My approach is a bit on the easy side, 99% of the ui was made in qtdesigner, so I pretty much skipped the how-to create part & focus more on assigning functionality, eventually I'll need to revisit this and learn, because the overall sizing of elements in the scrollable widget need work
- Sidebar trigger needs better placement (preferably by having the tab index moved left. Im going to end up blowing up this entire layout just to accomplish that
- Dialog buttons need to be replaced in favor of toggle switches. There was a hacky approach that I thought of, using ui/button/toggle gifs and setting the gifs to a midway state on selection, then end/begin state on unselection. Harder then it seems. Might need a library instead
- Notification, button inputs need better visual acknowledgement
