###### ...a tool to git userChrome Themes from anywhere.

</div>

## Overview:

A cross-platform gui for gituserChrome, written in python & QT, the goal is to create a lightweight frontend for browsing, managing, & installing userChrome themes onto any firefox profile, into any firefox install, all in about 1-3 clicks.

> This is also my first attempt at making a gui for anything & first attempt at using python, so we'll see how this goes.. Source will be up once I settle on content structure.
