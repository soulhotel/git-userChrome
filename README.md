<!--
- What enticed me to try tauri: Once it came time to build the qt iteration of gui, I skipped building for linux because I already knew building there would be easy. I went to Windows to produce a build. I was met with headaches.
- Moving over to tauri was easy, I created the basic html, css, for the application in 1 day, maybe 7 hours total. Now I just have to convert the exact same functionality that I already established.
- Also I dont need to "build" a toggle button. Win.
- I'm loving this work flow so far.
